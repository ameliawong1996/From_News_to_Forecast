On 2020-06-30, in the state of VIC, the news was: 'Victoria has recorded 64 new cases of coronavirus today and Australian health experts say it’s time authorities implemented tougher restrictions on known hot spots.'. Rationality behind it: Continued escalation of COVID-19 cases and the consequent restrictions potentially lead to reduced commercial and industrial activities, influencing a long-term decrease in load consumption. On 2020-06-30, in the state of VIC, the news was: 'At midnight a large chunk of Melbourne goes into lockdown. This is what it means for the 310,000 Melburnians living in the 10 COVID hot spot postcodes and why the rest of the state is watching on nervously.'. Rationality behind it: The immediate response to the lockdown including increased residential energy use from people staying at home could temporarily raise electricity demand.

On 2020-07-01, in the state of National, the news was: 'The pandemic has ended almost a year of consecutive growth for the region’s property market, which saw values slide in June.'. Rationality behind it: Changes in the property market due to the pandemic could affect urban development, potentially influencing long-term energy consumption patterns as new areas develop or old areas are revitalized. On 2020-07-01, in the state of VIC, the news was: 'Victoria heading back into lockdown shows that life is unlikely to return to normal any time soon. Here is how your day-to-day life will change.'. Rationality behind it: The reintroduction of lockdowns increases residential electricity use due to more people staying at home, impacting short-term load consumption. On 2020-07-01, in the state of VIC, the news was: 'Victoria has recorded a shocking new record increase in the spread of coronavirus. But are we really in the middle of a 'second wave'?'. Rationality behind it: Increasing coronavirus cases and potential heightened alert levels will make people stay and work from home longer, increasing electricity usage in the short term.

On 2020-01-26, in the state of Global, the news was: 'The number of confirmed cases of the Novel Coronavirus in China has risen to more than 2300, and the death toll has leapt to 80.'. Rationality behind it: The growing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely lead to long-term changes in public health policies, commercial activities, and workplace norms, influencing energy consumption patterns globally and regionally in terms of both increases in residential demand and fluctuations in commercial and industrial sectors. On 2020-01-26, in the state of SA, the news was: 'Four people in South Australia are being tested for the deadly coronavirus as four cases in Australia are confirmed.'. Rationality behind it: The announcement and management of health emergencies like the coronavirus can lead to immediate increases in electricity usage due to heightened activity in healthcare facilities, increased public communication needs, and possibly greater use of air filtration and ventilation systems.",
