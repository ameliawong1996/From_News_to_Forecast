This repository contains the code and dataset for our paper: **"From News to Forecast: Iterative Event Reasoning in LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting"**, presented at NeurIPS 2024.

## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance time series forecasting using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents. Our method integrates real-world social events, extracted from news, with traditional time series data. This allows our model to respond to unexpected incidents and societal shifts, improving the accuracy of predictions.

The main components of our system are:
- **LLM-based agents**: Automatically filter and analyze relevant news for time series forecasting.
- **Reasoning logic updates**: Refine the selection of news and improve prediction accuracy iteratively.

## Features

- Integration of unstructured news data into numerical time series forecasting.
- Iterative event reasoning through LLMs to continuously refine predictions.
- Application across multiple domains, including energy, exchange, bitcoin, and traffic forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study spans various sectors, such as:
- Electricity demand from Australia.
- Exchange rates.
- Bitcoin prices.
- Traffic volume data.
