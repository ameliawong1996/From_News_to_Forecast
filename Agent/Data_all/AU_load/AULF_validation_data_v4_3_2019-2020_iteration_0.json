On 2019-12-03, in the state of National, the news was: 'A groundbreaking new piece of technology is on the way and set to transform the way you live, work and play.'. Rationality behind it: The introduction of new high-energy technologies typically increases the base load consumption as they become integrated into everyday activities and industries. On 2019-12-03, in the state of National, the news was: 'More than 206 heat records have been broken in just 90 days in Australia. And worse is yet to come, with 50C summer days tipped.'. Rationality behind it: Extreme heat waves lead to increased use of air conditioning and cooling systems, resulting in higher electricity consumption. On 2019-12-03, in the state of SA, the news was: 'It’s officially jacaranda season in Adelaide, even though it might not feel like summer. But that will soon change as later this week temperatures are set to reach the mid to high 30s.'.

On 2019-12-04, in the state of National, the news was: 'It’s the spectacular new festival is coming to Australia.'. Rationality behind it: Festivals, especially large ones, cause short-term increases in electricity usage due to lighting, sound systems, and other operational needs. On 2019-12-04, in the state of National, the news was: 'Out of favour Australian opener Marcus Harris thought his career was finished when he dropped Ben Stokes in the third Ashes Test, but the selectors have a simple message for him.'.

On 2019-05-22, in the state of Unknown, the news was: 'Buyers have been banging down the door for their chance to grab a block of land in a new subdivision – with stage one sold out before it officially hit the market.'. Rationality behind it: This indicates a growing interest in new residential or commercial spaces, likely to lead to urban expansion and population growth, thereby increasing long-term electricity demand for development and residency.On 2019-05-23, in the state of Unknown, the news was: 'Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has swept to a huge election victory, his foreign minister says, giving his party a mandate to pursue policies that put Hindus first.'.

On 2019-12-25, in the state of Unknown, the news was: 'Bushfires continue to rage across the country, with firies powering on after more than 1200 homes were lost or destroyed.'. Rationality behind it: During bushfires, areas may experience increased load consumption due to emergency response equipment, evacuations, and community support activities. Additionally, fires can damage infrastructure leading to urgent consumption and restoration needs.On 2019-12-26, in the state of Unknown, the news was: 'Crews are struggling to contain a fire raging at a woodchip plant, with fears the blaze could continue to burn for days as air quality plummets.'. Rationality behind it: Long-term effects could stem from industrial fires like this, as they may lead to increased safety protocols and energy usage policies in industrial sectors, potentially increasing the demand for energy through the implementation of more rigorous and energy-intensive safety systems. On 2019-12-26, in the state of National, the news was: 'Soaring temperatures and dry winds are tipped to hit Australia, massively increasing the risk of bushfires and smoke haze for New Year’s Eve.'. Rationality behind it: The forecasted extreme weather conditions can lead to higher electricity consumption as residents and businesses ramp up the use of air conditioning and cooling systems to handle the heat, coupled with potential usage of electric devices due to staying indoors. On 2019-12-26, in the state of Unknown, the news was: 'no suitable news'.
